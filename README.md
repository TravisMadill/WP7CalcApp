# WP7CalcApp
This is a Windows Phone 7 app I made as one of the final projects in my Grade 12 programming class... And until I made this, I had no idea that Windows Phones actually existed.

Because this was an actual project for me, this repository contains some stuff I wouldn't normally include in my usual mini-projects, like flowcharts and detailed comments and an actual readme file.

## Original readme to my programming teacher
This app basically acts like a basic scientific calculator. It contains
most of the functions that a scientific calculator would normally have.

Those functions include:
* Basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* Exponents
* Variable roots
* One-number memory (Standard on most calculators) 
* Factorials (Integers only)
* Logarithms to custom bases
* Standard trigonometric functions
* A modulus operator

It's a pretty standard calculator that you'd expect from a phone.
Not much else to explain here.
